    <!--Description of the Recipe-->
    <p>
        This is a simple vegan pancake recipe that has been the highlight of many
        a Sunday brunch. A version made with chocolate chips in particular is a fan
        favorite of my partner. The fluffiness is mainly achieved though the inclusion of
        apple cider vinegar which lends an airiness to the pancakes. Makes approximately 6
        medium sized pancakes.
