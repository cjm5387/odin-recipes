    <h1>Broccoli Cheddar Soup</h1>

    <h4>Estimated Time: 45 minutes</h4>
    <!--Description of Soup--> <!--For some reason link inside the link isnt working-->
    <p>I've always been a fan of soup. One of my favorites was the broccoli cheddar 
        soup from Panera Bread. So after going vegan I diligently worked on how I 
        could possibly recreate a vegan version.  This recipe was birthed out of an
        adaptation of <a href="recipes/vegancheese.html">vegan cheese</a> recipe. I thought that the vegan potato and carrot
        cheese would lend itself perfectly to be the base of a cheddar soup. So utilizing
        some of the same ingredients as our vegan cheese we added some coconut milk to add
        some extra creaminess.
