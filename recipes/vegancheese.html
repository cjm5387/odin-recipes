    <!--Description of the Cheese-->
    <p>This is a versatile creamy vegan cheese recipe. It is best used
        for a dipping sauce or the cheese in a vegan mac and cheese. It is 
        a majority potato and carrot based that yields an earthy and smooth
        taste.  This was that first cheese recipe I learned how to make all
        the way back in 2014!  </p>
